=================================
Change log for risclog.sqlalchemy
=================================

1.5.1 (2014-03-31)
==================

- Moved the project to bitbucket.org and prepared for public release.


1.5 (2014-03-06)
================

- Adjust test dependency for external projects, so pyramid is not required.
  (#1458)


1.4 (2014-01-27)
================

- Do not truncate `spatial_ref_sys` when emptying entire database. (#13144)


1.3 (2013-12-18)
================

- Do not truncate `alembic_versions` when emptying entire database (using
  `db.empty(engine)`)

- Fix create_defaults, so it can be used with multiple engines. (#1172)


1.2 (2013-12-13)
================

- Fixed setup.py


1.1 (2013-12-13)
================

- Allow ``.db.Database.empty()`` to not restart sequences. (This can be
  necassary if the user is not allowed to call `ALTER SEQUENCE`.)

- Create factory for JSON renderer, so it can be customized via arguments.
  (#1037)


1.0 (2013-12-11)
================

- CAUTION: Backward incompatible changes to provide multiple database
  support. You need to change:

  * Use the ``pyramid`` extra to use the pyramid serializers and call
    ``.serializer.patch()`` by yourself.

  * Changes in `.model`:

    + Use `.model.declarative_base(cls)` to register a class as SQLALchemy
      ``declarative_base``.

    + Use your own declarative_base as `.model.Object` has been dropped.

    + Create your own `ReflectedObject` as `.model.ReflectedObject` has been
      dropped.

  * Changes in `.db.Database`:

    + To get an instance use `.db.get_database(testing=<True|False>)`.

    + To register a database with the utility use ``register_engine``.

    + ``empty`` now expects to get the engine as first argument and allows to
      cadcade via (``cascade=True``).


    + ``_verify`` was removed, use ``_verify_engine`` now.

    + ``setup_utility`` was removed, it is now done in ``__init__``.

    + To access former ``engine``` attribute use ``get_engine``.

    + ``close`` was renamed to ``drop_engine``.

    + To create all tables for a database use ``create_all``.

  * Changes in `.testing`:

    + ``setUpDB`` lost its first argument as it was not used.

    + ``setUp`` now expects a dict or ``None``, see its docstring.

- Provide a way to insert default values for new created models. (#1137)

- Added support for schema migrations with alembic.

- Dropped support for `Python 2.6`.

- Added convenience functions to create `py.test` database fixtures.

- Declared `pyramid` as test dependency so tests only need the ``test``
  extra.

- Declared testing dependency on `plone.testing[test]` since we use
  `plone.testing.zca` which imports that ``test`` extra's dependencies.


0.6 (2013-06-27)
================

- Added convenience methods on `.db.Database` for teardown in tests.

- Updated to Buildout 2.

- Using py.test as testrunner.

- Added Python 3.3 compatibility.


0.5 (2013-06-14)
================

- Add Database methods for setting up a database utility and emptying tables.

- Add testing layer that sets up a database utility (requires plone.testing).


0.4 (2013-06-07)
================

- Add helper to provide transparent json encoding of sqlalchemy mapped objects,
  dates, datetimes and decimals. (#39)

- Add `create_defaults` class method on base model which can be used to create
  test data into the database.


0.3 (2013-06-04)
================

- Repair db setup for reflected and unreflected objects.


0.2 (2013-06-04)
================

- Add unreflected Object model next to the reflected Object model.


0.1 (2013-06-03)
================

initial release
